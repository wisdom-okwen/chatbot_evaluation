"How effective is PrEP at preventing HIV transmission between partners?","PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is highly effective at preventing HIV transmission between partners. When taken consistently as prescribed, it reduces the risk of HIV infection from sexual activity by about 99%. For individuals who inject drugs, PrEP also significantly lowers the risk. It's essential to combine PrEP with regular testing and open communication with partners for optimal protection. If you have more questions about PrEP or its effectiveness, feel free to ask!","0.0","0.77"
"How about asking about the real-world studies that demonstrate PrEP's efficacy? **""Are there real-world studies showing how well PrEP works for couples like mine?""**","Yes, there are real-world studies demonstrating PrEP's efficacy, particularly among couples. For instance:

- **Partners PrEP Study**: This study showed a 75% reduction in HIV transmission among serodiscordant couples (where one partner is HIV-positive and the other is HIV-negative) when the HIV-negative partner used PrEP consistently.

- **HPTN 052 Study**: This study indicated that when the HIV-positive partner was on effective treatment, the risk of transmission was significantly reduced, and combining this with the HIV-negative partner taking PrEP further enhanced protection.

These studies underscore PrEP's effectiveness in preventing HIV transmission in couples. If you have more questions about specific studies or need further information, feel free to ask!","0.0","1.17"
"Does my partner’s viral load affect whether I need PrEP?","Yes, your partner's viral load significantly impacts whether you need PrEP. If your partner is HIV-positive, knowing their viral load is crucial:

- **Undetectable Viral Load**: If your partner is on effective treatment and has an undetectable viral load, the risk of transmission is negligible, and PrEP may not be necessary.
  
- **Detectable Viral Load**: If your partner has a detectable viral load, using PrEP can greatly reduce your risk of contracting HIV.

Discussing your partner's status and options with a healthcare provider can help determine the best approach for your situation. If you have more questions about this topic, feel free to ask!","0.0","1.08"
"How strict do I need to be with taking PrEP every day?","It's important to take PrEP every day as prescribed for optimal effectiveness. Missing doses can significantly reduce its protective benefits against HIV. Consistency is key; if you consistently take PrEP daily, it can reduce the risk of HIV infection by about 99%. If you have trouble with adherence, consider discussing alternative options, like injectable PrEP (CAB-LA), which is administered every two months. If you have more questions about PrEP or adherence, feel free to ask!","0.0","0.73"
"What happens if I miss a dose—does my risk of HIV increase immediately?","If you miss a dose of PrEP, it doesn't immediately increase your risk of HIV, but consistency is crucial for effectiveness. Here's what to do:

- **Take it ASAP**: If you remember within 12 hours, take the missed dose immediately.
- **Skip if Close**: If it's nearly time for your next dose, skip the missed one and resume your regular schedule.

"What about interactions with other medications? **""Can PrEP interact with other medications I take?""**","Yes, PrEP can interact with certain medications. Here are some key points:

- **Consult Your Doctor**: If you take feminizing hormones, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen), or Hepatitis C medications, consult your healthcare provider about potential interactions.
