"What exactly is PrEP, and how does it work? Would it be effective for someone like me?","PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a preventive medication for individuals at high risk of HIV. It typically comes in the form of a daily pill (Truvada) or a bimonthly injection (CAB-LA).

**How PrEP Works:**
- **Mechanism:** PrEP creates barriers in the body's cells that HIV would target, preventing the virus from establishing an infection.
- **Effectiveness:** When taken consistently, daily oral PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and over 70% for injection drug use. Injectable PrEP is similarly effective.

To determine if PrEP is right for you, consider discussing your risk factors and sexual health with a healthcare provider.","0.0","0.67"
