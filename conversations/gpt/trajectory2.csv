### Scientific Questions

1. **Mechanism of Action:**
   - How does PrEP work at a cellular level to prevent the replication of the HIV virus?
   - What specific drug classes are used in PrEP, and what are their mechanisms of action?

2.","Absolutely, I can help with that!

### Scientific Questions

1. **Mechanism of Action:**
   - PrEP works by utilizing antiretroviral drugs that inhibit HIV from entering and infecting cells. These medications prevent the virus from replicating by blocking its ability to integrate into the host's DNA.

2. **Drug Classes:**
   - The primary drug used in PrEP is **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate** (TDF) and **Emtricitabine** (FTC). TDF is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that blocks reverse transcription, while FTC is also an NRTI that prevents HIV replication.

### Scientific Questions

1. **Mechanism of Action:**
   - **Active Ingredients Interaction**: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and Emtricitabine (FTC) work by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is essential for HIV to convert its RNA into DNA.
