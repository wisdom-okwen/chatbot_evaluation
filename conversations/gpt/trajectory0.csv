First of all, can you explain what PrEP is? I’ve heard about it as a medication for HIV prevention, but I'm not entirely clear on how it works. How do people take it, and who should consider using it? 

Also, I’ve heard that PrEP is highly effective in reducing the risk of HIV. Can you provide more details on just how effective it is? Are there any statistics or studies that show its success","Certainly! 

**What is PrEP?**
- PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a medication for HIV prevention, specifically designed for individuals who are HIV-negative but at high risk of infection.
- It works by blocking HIV from entering and infecting cells, creating a protective barrier.

**How is it taken?**
- PrEP is typically taken as a daily pill (e.g., Truvada) or a bimonthly injection (CAB-LA).
- For maximum effectiveness, it should be taken consistently as prescribed.

**Who should consider using it?**
- Individuals with partners who are HIV-positive and not on treatment.
- Those with multiple sexual partners or inconsistent condom use.
- People who inject drugs and share needles.

**Effectiveness:**
- Daily oral PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken consistently.
- Injectable PrEP (CAB-LA) shows similar effectiveness when administered every two months.

**Statistics and Studies:**
- Clinical trials demonstrate that the majority of participants experienced no significant side effects.
- A study involving 8,390 individuals found that PrEP effectively reduced new HIV infections, confirming its role as a vital prevention tool.
