1. Where do ratings deviate from the average?

    Are there specific conversations or turns that are rated much lower or higher than average?

    Which criteria tend to have the most variation?

2. Are there differences between the perspectives?

    Does the chatbot rate itself differently than users or observers rate it?

    Are there criteria where the chatbotâ€™s self-assessment is consistently higher or lower than external assessments?

3. Do criteria ratings correlate with overall ratings?

    Which criteria have the strongest influence on the overall rating?

    Are there criteria that are less correlated with the overall rating?

4. Temporal Trends:

    Do ratings change over time or improve as the chatbot is fine-tuned?

    Are there trends in specific criteria over time?

5. Distribution and Spread:

    Even if most ratings are around 9.0, what does the distribution look like?

    Are there specific criteria that have more spread (variance) than others?
