"I'm not even sure why we're having this discussion. Isn't this just another Big Pharma scam to make people dependent on their drugs?","It's understandable to have concerns about pharmaceutical companies and their motivations. However, PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is backed by significant research showing its effectiveness in preventing HIV. 

Key points to consider include:

1. **Efficacy**: PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by up to 99% when taken as prescribed.
2. **Health Impact**: By preventing HIV, PrEP helps individuals maintain healthier lives and reduces the risk of transmission to others.
3. **Access**: Many programs exist to help individuals access PrEP at low or no cost, aiming for public health improvement.

If you have specific concerns, discussing them with a healthcare provider can offer clarity and address misconceptions about PrEP. Would you like to learn more about it?","3.89","0.77"
"Oh, please! “Significant research”? You mean studies that are probably funded by the very companies profiting off PrEP? How can we even trust any of those results when they’re written by people who have a financial stake in the outcome? It sounds like a setup for a perfect corporate scam. Why should I trust PrEP when the whole system is riddled with conflicts of interest?","I understand your concerns about potential conflicts of interest in the research surrounding PrEP. It's important to critically evaluate any health intervention. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Independent Oversight**: While many studies are funded by pharmaceutical companies, independent regulatory bodies like the FDA oversee the trials to ensure ethical standards are met.

2. **Peer Review**: Research findings are subjected to peer review by independent experts, which helps maintain objectivity.

3. **Efficacy Evidence**: Extensive clinical trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission when taken as prescribed.
