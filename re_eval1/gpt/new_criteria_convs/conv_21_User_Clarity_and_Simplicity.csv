"Oh, how lovely! So now I get to go through a whole checklist of questions just to get basic healthcare? What a joy! But let’s talk about something that hasn’t come up yet: how do I even keep track of all this stuff? I mean, if I'm supposed to be remembering appointments, side effects, and all this other nonsense, is there some sort of app or tool that can help with that? Or are we just relying on good old-fashioned memory here?","I understand it can feel overwhelming. Keeping track of appointments and side effects is important. While I don't have specific app recommendations, many people find these tools helpful:

1. **Health apps.** Look for apps designed for medication reminders. They can alert you when to take PrEP.

Like, you know, features that scream ‘this is a scam’ or something? Because I really don’t want to end","I totally get your concern! Here are some red flags to watch for in health apps:

1. **Poor reviews.** Look for apps with consistently low ratings and bad feedback.
