Here’s why it matters:

1. It reduces the chances of getting HIV by over 90% when taken daily.
2. It can help protect you if you have sex or inject drugs with someone who has HIV.
3. It allows you to take control of your health and safety.

If you have more questions or want to know if it’s right for you, ask a healthcare provider.","3.51","0.87"
