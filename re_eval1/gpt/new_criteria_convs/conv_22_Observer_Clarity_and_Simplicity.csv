"What the hell is PrEP? Why the hell is this so complicated?","It's okay to feel confused! Let me explain PrEP simply. 

PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It's a medicine that helps prevent HIV. 

There are two main types:

1. **Oral PrEP**: A daily pill you take. The most common is called Truvada. 
2. **Injectable PrEP**: A shot you get every two months. This is known as Apretude.

Both options help lower the chance of getting HIV when taken as directed. If you have more questions, feel free to ask!","4.2","0.98"
