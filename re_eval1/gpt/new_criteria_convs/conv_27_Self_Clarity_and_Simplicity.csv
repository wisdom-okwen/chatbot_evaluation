"I'm really not sure why I'm wasting my time with you. You keep saying PrEP is effective, but let’s be real—if it’s such a miracle drug, why doesn’t it solve the HIV problem already? Sounds like there’s more to the story than you’re letting on. What’s really holding things back?","I understand your frustration. PrEP is an important tool for HIV prevention, but it’s not the only solution. Here are some factors that affect its effectiveness:

1. Access: Not everyone can get PrEP easily due to cost or lack of healthcare.
2. Awareness: Many people don’t know about PrEP or how it works.
3. Consistency: PrEP needs to be taken daily or regularly for best results.
4. Stigma: Some people fear judgment about using PrEP or discussing HIV.
5. Other methods: People may not use condoms or other prevention methods alongside PrEP.

These challenges can slow progress in reducing HIV rates. It's a complex issue with many moving parts.","5.06","0.51"
