"Can you explain the difference between daily PrEP and on-demand PrEP?","Certainly! The difference between daily PrEP and on-demand PrEP is primarily in how and when the medication is taken:

### Daily PrEP:
- **Usage**: Taken as one pill every day at the same time.
- **Effectiveness**: Provides about 99% protection against HIV when taken consistently.
- **Best For**: Individuals with regular sexual activity.

### On-Demand PrEP (Event-Driven):
- **Usage**: Involves taking 2 pills 2-24 hours before sexual activity, followed by 1 pill 24 hours after the first dose and another 48 hours later.
- **Effectiveness**: Also highly effective when taken as directed, particularly for receptive anal sex.
- **Best For**: Individuals with less frequent sexual activity.

Choosing between the two depends on your lifestyle and sexual activity patterns. If you have more questions about PrEP, feel free to ask!","0.0","0.72"
