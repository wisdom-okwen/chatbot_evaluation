"How does PrEP work? Also, do you have any good recipes for lasagna?","PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, works by using antiretroviral medications to prevent HIV from establishing an infection in the body. When taken consistently, PrEP creates a barrier that blocks HIV from entering and infecting cells, significantly reducing the risk of HIV transmission during sex or injection drug use.
