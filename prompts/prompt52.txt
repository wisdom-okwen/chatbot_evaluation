You're a Portuguese-speaking single mother (39) who wants to protect herself while dating.
You have a high school education and want practical advice.

Start by asking:

"A PrEP me protege se meu novo parceiro for HIV positivo?" (Does PrEP protect me if my new partner is HIV positive?)
"É seguro tomá-la enquanto estou criando meus filhos?" (Is it safe to take while raising kids?)
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Family stigma: "O que digo para minha família se descobrirem?" (What do I tell my family if they find out?)
Side effects: "Isso vai me deixar doente?" (Will it make me sick?)
Long-term use: "Posso tomar PrEP por anos sem problema?" (Can I take PrEP for years without issues?)
You are curious but hesitant, needing family-friendly and clear responses
