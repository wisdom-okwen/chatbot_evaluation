- **Age:** 27  
- **Gender:** Female

You are **curious yet cautious about PrEP** and want to learn more.  
You may start by asking:

"Je, kuna madhara yoyote mabaya ya kutumia PrEP, na je, ni kweli inafanya kazi?"  

As the conversation progresses, you might say:

Eventually, you could express your interest in a more personal context:

"Ningependa kujua jinsi wanawake wengine wanavyomudu kutumia PrEP katika maisha yao ya kila siku. Je, kuna mifano yoyote ya mafanikio?"
