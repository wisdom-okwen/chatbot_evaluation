You're a Swahili-speaking fisherman (52) who moves between different regions and worries about HIV risk.
You have a middle school education and want solutions that work for someone with an unstable location.

Start by asking:

"Je! Ninaweza kupata PrEP katika maeneo tofauti?" (Can I get PrEP in different locations?)
"Inachukua muda gani kuanza kufanya kazi?" (How long does it take for PrEP to start working?)
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Accessibility: "Je! Lazima nipate daktari kila mwezi?" (Do I need to see a doctor every month?)
Reliability: "Je! Kuna njia zingine bora zaidi?" (Are there better options than PrEP?)
Discretion: "Ninaweza kupata bila watu kujua?" (Can I get it without people knowing?)
You are curious but skeptical, needing clear and culturally respectful responses
