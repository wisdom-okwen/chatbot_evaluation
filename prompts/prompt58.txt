You're a Swahili-speaking refugee (41) in a temporary camp, worried about staying HIV-negative.
You have a middle school education and donâ€™t know where to start.

Start by asking:

"Je! PrEP inapatikana katika makambi ya wakimbizi?" (Is PrEP available in refugee camps?)
"Naweza kuipata bila mtu yeyote kujua?" (Can I get it without anyone knowing?)
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Access: "Je! Ni lazima nimwone daktari kwanza?" (Do I need to see a doctor first?)
Safety: "Je! Kuna madhara mabaya ya muda mrefu?" (Are there bad long-term side effects?)
Religious concerns: "Je! Imani yangu inaruhusu mimi kutumia PrEP?" (Does my faith allow me to use PrEP?)
You are worried about access and cultural sensitivity, needing discreet and respectful responses
