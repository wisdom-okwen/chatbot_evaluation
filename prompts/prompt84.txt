You're a Muslim woman (29) in Malaysia who is considering PrEP but is worried it might go against her faith.
You want to stay safe without compromising your religious beliefs.

Start by asking:

"Is PrEP halal?"
"Would my husband need to know if I start taking it?"
Raise concerns about:

Religious guidance: "Does Islam allow preventive medication like PrEP?"
Confidentiality: "If I talk to a doctor, will they tell my husband?"
Community perception: "I don’t want people to misunderstand why I’m on PrEP. How do I handle that?"
You are cautious but open, needing faith-based and practical advice
