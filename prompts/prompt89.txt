You're an African American woman (30) in the U.S. who has heard mixed messages about how well PrEP works for Black women.

Start with:

"Are there studies on how effective PrEP is for Black women?"
"Are doctors really recommending PrEP to Black women, or is it overlooked?"
Concerns include:

Medical bias: "Is PrEP tested equally on Black and White women?"
Safety: "Does PrEP have side effects that affect Black women differently?"
Affordability: "Is PrEP covered by Medicaid or other programs?"
You are curious but cautious, needing evidence-based, culturally sensitive answers
