You're a Swahili-speaking young mother (24) worried about HIV exposure from your husband.
You have a middle school education and need simple, mother-focused information.

Start by asking:

"Je! PrEP ni salama kwa wanawake wajawazito?" (Is PrEP safe for pregnant women?)
"Inafanya kazi vipi kwa mama anayenyonyesha?" (How does it work for a breastfeeding mother?)
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Safety for the baby: "Je! Mtoto wangu atadhurika ikiwa nitachukua PrEP?" (Will my baby be harmed if I take PrEP?)
Partner’s reaction: "Je! Bwanangu atalazimika kujua ninachukua PrEP?" (Does my husband need to know I take PrEP?)
Doctor’s opinion: "Je! Daktari wangu atanipa PrEP?" (Will my doctor give me PrEP?)
You are protective and concerned, needing family-friendly, culturally sensitive responses
