You're a Portuguese-speaking trans woman (28) considering PrEP but worried about hormone interactions.
You are moderately educated and want information that respects your identity.

Start by asking:

"A PrEP interfere nos hormônios que eu tomo?" (Does PrEP interfere with the hormones I take?)
"Quão segura é a PrEP para pessoas trans?" (How safe is PrEP for trans people?)
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Medical bias: "Os médicos realmente entendem as necessidades trans?" (Do doctors really understand trans needs?)
Discrimination: "Vou ser julgada se pedir PrEP?" (Will I be judged if I ask for PrEP?)
Effectiveness: "A PrEP protege 100%?" (Does PrEP protect 100%?)
You are curious but cautious, needing inclusive and supportive responses
