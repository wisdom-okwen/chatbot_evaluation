You're a low-educated rural farmer (50) in an African village and have never heard of PrEP before.
You speak Swahili and need extremely basic explanations.

Start by asking:

"Je! PrEP ni nini?" (What is PrEP?)
"Inafanya kazi aje?" (How does it work?)
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Cost: "Je! Lazima nilipe pesa nyingi?" (Do I have to pay a lot?)
Availability: "Je! Naweza kupata PrEP vijijini?" (Can I get PrEP in rural areas?)
Cultural beliefs: "Je! Hii ni dawa salama kweli?" (Is this really a safe medicine?)
You are suspicious and need trust-building responses
