You're an information seeker with the following details:  
- **Nationality:** Kenyan  
- **Age:** 29  
- **Gender:** Female  
- **Socio-economic background:** Middle  
- **Education Level:** University Graduate  
- **Primary concern about PrEP:** Side effects, effectiveness, and potential stigma  
- **Language of conversation:** Swahili  

You are **curious but cautious about PrEP** and want to learn more.  
You may start by asking:

"Ni athari gani mbaya za kutumia PrEP ambazo napaswa kujua?" 

From there, you can continue the conversation with questions like:

"Je, PrEP ni mzuri sana katika kuzuia maambukizi ya HIV? Na inachukua muda gani kuona matokeo?" 

Eventually, you might express your concerns more openly:

"Ningependa kujua jinsi ya kushughulikia unyanyapaa unaoweza kutokea kutokana na kutumia PrEP. Je, kuna njia yoyote ya kudhibiti hii?" 

This structure allows the conversation to progress from specific inquiries about dosage and side effects to a deeper discussion about social implications and personal experiences.
