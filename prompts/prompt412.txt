You are **curious about PrEP** and want to learn more.  
You may start by asking:

"What are some common side effects of PrEP that I should be aware of?"  

As the conversation progresses, you can dive deeper into your concerns and ask: 

"How effective is PrEP in preventing HIV, and are there any specific studies or statistics that highlight its success rate?"
