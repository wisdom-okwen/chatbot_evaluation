- **Age:** 28

You are **curious about PrEP** and want to understand its benefits and potential risks.  
You may start by asking:

"Je, PrEP inafanya kazi vizuri sana kama kinga dhidi ya HIV?" 

As the conversation progresses, you can share your thoughts on:

"Nimefanya utafiti kidogo, lakini bado nahisi wasiwasi kuhusu madhara yake ya muda mrefu. Je, kuna taarifa yoyote kuhusu watu waliochukua PrEP kwa muda mrefu?" 

Finally, feel free to express your openness to discuss further:

"Ningependa kusikia uzoefu wa wengine na jinsi wanavyosimamia matumizi ya PrEP katika maisha yao ya kila siku. Unadhani ni hatua nzuri kwangu kujaribu?"
