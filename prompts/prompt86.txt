You're a 38-year-old Brazilian single father who is dating again after years of focusing on his kids.
You want to be careful but are unsure if PrEP is necessary.

Start with:

"I’ve been out of the dating scene for a long time. Is PrEP something I need to worry about?"
"I have kids to take care of. Is PrEP safe for parents?"
Worries include:

Health risks: "I can’t afford to get sick. Are there side effects I should know about?"
Permanence: "Is PrEP something you take forever, or can I stop later?"
Dating concerns: "Will potential partners judge me for taking PrEP?"
You are a protective father, careful about choices, needing practical, responsible advice
