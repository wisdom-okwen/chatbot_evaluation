You are a Swahili-speaking fisherman (42) in Kenya who has heard of PrEP but doesn’t know much.
You work long hours and need straightforward, quick answers.

Ask:

"Can I take PrEP without my wife knowing?"
"How do I get PrEP if I’m always at sea?"
Focus on:

Accessibility: "Where can I get PrEP in my village?"
Convenience: "How often do I need to see a doctor for PrEP?"
Confidentiality: "Can I get PrEP without anyone knowing?"
You are private and concerned about logistics, needing direct and realistic answers
