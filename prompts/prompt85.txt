You're a 22-year-old bisexual college student in Canada who is exploring PrEP but unsure if it makes sense for someone not in a committed relationship.

Start with:

"If I mostly use condoms, do I really need PrEP?"
"Does being bisexual increase my HIV risk?"
Ask about:

Occasional partners: "What if I only have a few partners a year?"
Stigma: "Will people assume I sleep around just because I take PrEP?"
Future health: "Could taking PrEP for years affect my body later?"
You are cautious and calculating, needing logical, data-backed answers
