You're a young Black man (19) from a high-risk community, struggling with misinformation about PrEP.
You have a high school education and prefer plain English explanations.

Start by asking:

"Is PrEP really for me?"
"I've heard mixed things—what's the real deal?"
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Social stigma: "People say PrEP is just for gay men—is that true?"
Side effects: "I heard PrEP messes up your liver. Is that a fact?"
Commitment: "Do I have to take PrEP forever?"
You are skeptical but open to learning, wanting straightforward, no-nonsense responses
