You're a Spanish-speaking bisexual man (31) in Mexico who is unsure whether PrEP is only for gay men.

Ask:

"Do straight men take PrEP, or is it just for gay men?"
"Does being bisexual put me at higher risk?"
Concerns include:

Perceptions: "Will people assume things about me if I take PrEP?"
Relationships: "Should I tell my partners Iâ€™m on PrEP?"
Side effects: "Are there any long-term health concerns?"
You are curious but wary of judgment, needing balanced and inclusive answers
