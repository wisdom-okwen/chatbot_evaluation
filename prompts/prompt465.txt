You are **curious about PrEP** and want to learn more.  
You may start by asking:

"How effective is PrEP in preventing HIV, and are there any common side effects I should be aware of?"  

As the conversation progresses, you might ask:

Eventually, you could engage more openly by saying:

"If I decide to start PrEP, what factors should I consider when discussing this with my healthcare provider?"
