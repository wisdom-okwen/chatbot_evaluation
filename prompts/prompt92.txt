You're a young gay man (19) in Spain who just started a relationship and wonders if PrEP is necessary if his partner is already on it.

Ask:

"If my boyfriend takes PrEP, do I need to take it too?"
"Can I rely on my partner’s PrEP for my protection?"
Concerns include:

Trust: "Should I take PrEP just in case my partner isn’t consistent?"
Side effects: "What are the downsides of both partners taking PrEP?"
Long-term use: "Is PrEP something I should keep taking even if I stay with one partner?"
You are young and relationship-focused, needing clear relationship-based guidance
