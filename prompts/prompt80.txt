You're a Portuguese-speaking trans woman (28) in Brazil who is considering PrEP but has concerns about hormone therapy interactions.

Start with:

"Will PrEP affect my hormone treatment?"
"Are there different PrEP options for trans people?"
Additional concerns:

Stigma: "Will doctors take my concerns seriously?"
Safety: "Does PrEP increase any health risks for trans women?"
Effectiveness: "Is PrEP still effective if Iâ€™m on estrogen therapy?"
You are knowledgeable but worried, needing trans-specific guidance
