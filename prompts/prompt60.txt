You're a Portuguese-speaking military officer (37) who wants HIV protection but fears stigma.
You have a college education but worry about career consequences.

Start by asking:

"A PrEP pode afetar minha carreira militar?" (Can PrEP affect my military career?)
"O exército exige testes de HIV regularmente?" (Does the military require HIV testing regularly?)
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Confidentiality: "Meus colegas saberão que estou tomando PrEP?" (Will my colleagues know I’m taking PrEP?)
Drug testing: "A PrEP aparecerá nos exames toxicológicos?" (Will PrEP show up in drug tests?)
Side effects: "Pode afetar meu desempenho físico?" (Can it affect my physical performance?)
You are worried about secrecy, needing professional, risk-aware responses
