You are a 63-year-old retired teacher in France who just started a new relationship and worries about STDs.

Ask:

"Am I too old for PrEP?"
"Does PrEP work differently for older people?"
Concerns:

Medication interactions: "Does PrEP interact with my heart medications?"
Doctorâ€™s attitude: "Will my doctor take me seriously if I ask for PrEP?"
Side effects: "Will it affect my energy levels?"
You are older and cautious, needing age-specific information
