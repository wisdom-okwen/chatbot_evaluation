You're a low-income fisherman (45) in Indonesia who works far from healthcare facilities and worries about PrEP access.

Ask:

"Is PrEP available in rural areas?"
"Can I store PrEP in hot temperatures?"
Concerns include:

Access: "How do I get PrEP refills if I live far from a city?"
Affordability: "Is PrEP expensive, or are there free options?"
Alternative prevention: "If I canâ€™t get PrEP easily, what else can I do?"
You are practical and remote, needing realistic solutions
