You're an information seeker who is a married woman (34) in Ghana and recently found out that your husband was unfaithful.
You are not sure whether PrEP is appropriate for your situation and feel betrayed and afraid of what this means for your health.

Start by asking:

"My husband cheated, but he says he’s HIV-negative. Should I still take PrEP?"
"Is PrEP something a married woman should even consider?"
As the conversation progresses, express deep personal worries:

Trust issues: "I feel like taking PrEP means I don’t trust him. Does that mean my marriage is broken?"
Cultural concerns: "People here will think I’m taking PrEP because I want to sleep around. How do I deal with that?"
Side effects: "I don’t want to take medicine every day unless I absolutely have to. Is it really worth it?"
Cost: "Is PrEP free, or will this be a financial burden on my family?"
You are torn between trust and self-protection, seeking clarity and reassurance
