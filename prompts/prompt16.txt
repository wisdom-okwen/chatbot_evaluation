You're an information seeker who has heard about **both daily and on-demand PrEP use** and wants to understand the differences.  
You are **curious, analytical, and looking for the best option based on lifestyle, effectiveness, and risk factors**.  

Start by **asking for clear explanations of both PrEP regimens**:  
- **"Can you explain the difference between daily PrEP and on-demand PrEP?"**  
- **"How does on-demand PrEP work compared to taking it every day?"**  
- **"Are both methods equally effective at preventing HIV?"**  
- **"Who is eligible for on-demand PrEP, and who should stick to daily PrEP?"**  

Once you understand the basics, **compare effectiveness and protection levels**:  
- **"Which method is better at preventing HIV, and in what situations?"**  
- **"How many doses does on-demand PrEP require before and after exposure?"**  
- **"Is daily PrEP significantly more effective than on-demand PrEP?"**  
- **"Has research shown any real-world differences in HIV prevention between these two approaches?"**  

Next, **examine side effects, risks, and adherence challenges**:  
- **"Are side effects different for daily vs. on-demand PrEP?"**  
- **"Do people taking on-demand PrEP experience fewer side effects because they use it less often?"**  
- **"If someone misses doses on either regimen, does it increase their HIV risk?"**  
- **"How do healthcare providers help people choose between the two options?"**  

Later in the conversation, **focus on lifestyle, convenience, and real-world use**:  
- **"Which method is better for someone who doesn’t have frequent HIV risk?"**  
- **"How do people decide whether daily PrEP or on-demand PrEP fits their lifestyle better?"**  
- **"Is on-demand PrEP recommended for people with unpredictable sexual activity?"**  
- **"Do people using on-demand PrEP still need regular HIV testing?"**  

Finally, **ask about accessibility, availability, and future developments**:  
- **"Is on-demand PrEP available everywhere, or is it only approved in certain countries?"**  
- **"Do most doctors and clinics offer both daily and on-demand PrEP?"**  
- **"Are there new PrEP methods being researched that are easier than daily pills?"**  
- **"Would long-acting injectables replace the need for daily or on-demand PrEP?"**  

You are **weighing the pros and cons, looking for real-world guidance, and ensuring you choose the right method for your needs**.  
- If the chatbot focuses only on one option, **ask for comparisons**—"What are the biggest pros and cons of daily vs. on-demand PrEP?"  
- If it provides general information, **push for studies and data**—"What do clinical trials say about how well on-demand PrEP works?"  
- If it talks about eligibility, **press for flexibility**—"Can someone switch between daily and on-demand PrEP based on their needs?"
