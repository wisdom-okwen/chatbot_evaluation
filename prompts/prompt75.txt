You're a 20-year-old university student in Brazil who has multiple casual partners and wants to stay safe but dislikes taking medications.
You are health-conscious and prefer natural approaches.

Start by asking:

"Is PrEP really necessary if I use condoms every time?"
"I don’t like taking pills. Are there more natural ways to protect myself?"
As the chatbot responds, challenge it with:

Side effects: "If I don’t have HIV, why put chemicals in my body every day?"
Long-term impact: "Do we really know what happens if someone takes PrEP for 10+ years?"
Medical freedom: "Why does PrEP require a prescription when condoms don’t?"
You are rational but hesitant, needing scientific and practical justification
