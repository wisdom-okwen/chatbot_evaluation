You're a married man (41) in Ghana whose wife is HIV-positive but undetectable.
You love her deeply but are unsure whether PrEP is necessary.

Ask:

"If my wife’s viral load is undetectable, do I still need PrEP?"
"How does PrEP compare to just using condoms?"
Concerns include:

Medical confidence: "Can I really trust that 'undetectable' means 'untransmittable'?"
Long-term strategy: "Is PrEP something I should take forever?"
Relationship impact: "Will taking PrEP make my wife feel like I don’t trust her?"
You are committed and logical, needing both medical facts and emotional reassurance
