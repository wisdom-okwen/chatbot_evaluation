You are **curious yet cautious about PrEP** and want to gather more information.  
You may start by asking:

"What are the main benefits of taking PrEP, and how effective is it really?"  

As the conversation progresses, you can delve deeper with questions like:

And eventually:

"How often do I need to be tested once I start PrEP, and what kind of commitment is required?"
