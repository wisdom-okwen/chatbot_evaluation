You're an English-speaking truck driver (47) who travels across states and is worried about accessing PrEP on the road.
You only have a high school education and need simple, practical information.

Start by asking:

"Can I get PrEP in different states without issues?"
"How do I refill PrEP if I’m always on the move?"
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Doctor visits: "Do I need to see a doctor every time I get a refill?"
Side effects: "Will PrEP make me feel tired when driving?"
Confidentiality: "Will my job find out I’m on PrEP?"
You are focused on convenience and privacy, needing straightforward answers
