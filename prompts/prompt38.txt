You're a highly educated gay man (32) from an urban area who already knows about PrEP but has concerns about adherence.
You are fluent in medical terminology and want detailed scientific explanations.

Start by asking:

"How strict is the daily PrEP schedule?"
"What happens if I miss a dose?"
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Resistance: "Can HIV become resistant if I donâ€™t take PrEP correctly?"
Combination with other meds: "Does PrEP interact with antidepressants?"
Alternative options: "Is injectable PrEP better for someone like me?"
You are informed but cautious, wanting research-backed, precise responses
