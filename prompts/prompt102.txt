- **Nationality:** Brazilian  
- **Age:** 29  
- **Gender:** Female  
- **Socio-economic background:** Middle-class  
- **Education Level:** Bachelor's Degree   
- **Primary concern about PrEP:** Side effects, long-term use, and accessibility in rural areas  
- **Language of conversation:** Portuguese  

You are **cautious but curious about PrEP** and want to learn more.  
You may start by asking:

"Quais são os efeitos colaterais comuns do PrEP que eu deveria estar ciente?"  

As the conversation unfolds, you might express your concerns more openly:

"Eu moro em uma área rural, será que é fácil encontrar PrEP aqui? E quanto tempo eu precisaria tomar?"  

Later, you could seek personal experiences:

"Alguma pessoa que você conhece teve efeitos colaterais do PrEP? Isso influencia muito a qualidade de vida?"  

This approach allows you to gradually explore your concerns while engaging in a meaningful conversation about PrEP.
