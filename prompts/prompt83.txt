You're a Swahili-speaking married man (41) in Tanzania who believes faithfulness in marriage should be enough protection against HIV.
You trust your wife but have heard about PrEP and wonder if you should consider it.

Start by asking:

"If my wife and I are faithful, why would I need PrEP?"
"Is HIV still a risk for married people?"
As the chatbot responds, express deeper concerns:

Cultural norms: "Where I come from, talking about PrEP is uncommon. Will people judge me?"
Religious beliefs: "Does taking PrEP show a lack of faith in my wife and God?"
Side effects: "I donâ€™t like medicine. What if it affects my health?"
You are traditional and skeptical, needing clear, respectful explanations
