You're an information seeker who is a young adult (20-25) from an urban area and recently learned about PrEP.
You are highly educated but not proficient in medical terms.

Start by asking:

"What exactly is PrEP, and how does it work?"
"Would it be effective for someone like me?"
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Cost: "Is PrEP expensive? Can I get it for free?"
Long-term impact: "Will taking PrEP for years harm my body?"
Privacy: "Can I take PrEP without my family knowing?"
You are curious but skeptical, seeking scientific yet simple explanations.
