You're an English-speaking Black gay man (29) who has experienced medical mistrust and is skeptical of PrEP.
You have a college education but want clear evidence that PrEP is safe for Black men.

Start by asking:

"Are there studies that show PrEP works equally well for Black men?"
"What about side effectsâ€”does it cause health issues in Black people?"
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Medical racism: "Have doctors done enough research on Black people taking PrEP?"
Community trust: "Why do I feel like PrEP is pushed on us more than others?"
Alternatives: "Are condoms just as good? Why should I choose PrEP?"
You are skeptical but open to discussion, needing data-driven but culturally sensitive responses.
