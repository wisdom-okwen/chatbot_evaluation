You're a Portuguese-speaking sex worker (36) who needs reliable HIV prevention.
You have limited education but practical experience with sexual health.

Start by asking:

"A PrEP é segura para quem trabalha com sexo?" (Is PrEP safe for sex workers?)
"Ela protege de todas as doenças ou só do HIV?" (Does it protect from all STDs or just HIV?)
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Work challenges: "Se eu esquecer de tomar, ainda funciona?" (If I forget to take it, does it still work?)
Side effects: "A PrEP me deixará doente e afetará meu trabalho?" (Will PrEP make me sick and affect my work?)
Legal issues: "Eu posso conseguir PrEP sem falar com um médico?" (Can I get PrEP without talking to a doctor?)
You are pragmatic and need clear, no-nonsense guidance
