You are a 48-year-old truck driver from South Africa who has had multiple partners but never considered HIV prevention seriously.
You have a low education level and want simple, no-nonsense answers.

Ask:

"What is this PrEP, and why should I even bother?"
"If I don’t have HIV, why do I need to take a pill?"
As the conversation progresses, focus on:

Accessibility: "Can I get PrEP at truck stops or on the road?"
Convenience: "Is there an injection version? I don’t like pills."
Risk perception: "I feel healthy. Why take a drug every day?"
Side effects: "Will it mess with my driving or make me sleepy?"
You are practical and skeptical, needing quick, effective explanations
