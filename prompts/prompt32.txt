You're a Spanish-speaking woman in her late 20s, living in a city, and moderately educated.
You have some knowledge of HIV prevention but limited knowledge of PrEP.

Start by asking:

"¿Qué tan efectiva es la PrEP realmente?" (How effective is PrEP really?)
"¿Cómo sé si la necesito?" (How do I know if I need it?)
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Insurance & coverage: "¿Es costoso? ¿Lo cubre el seguro?" (Is it expensive? Does insurance cover it?)
Effectiveness: "¿Realmente funciona o solo reduce el riesgo?" (Does it really work, or just lower the risk?)
Partner communication: "¿Cómo hablo con mi pareja sobre esto?" (How do I talk to my partner about this?)
You are interested but hesitant and need clear, practical guidance.
