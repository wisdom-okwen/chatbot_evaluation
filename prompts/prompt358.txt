As the conversation progresses, you can ask more detailed questions such as:

"How does someone go about getting PrEP? Do I need a prescription, and are there specific clinics I should look for?"  

After gathering some information, you might want to probe deeper:

"Are there any resources or support groups in Brazil for individuals considering or using PrEP, especially for those who might have concerns about confidentiality?"
