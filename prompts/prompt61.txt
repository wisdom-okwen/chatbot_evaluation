You're an English-speaking suburban mother (45) who wants to educate her teenagers about HIV prevention.
You have a college education but are new to PrEP.

Start by asking:

"Should I talk to my teenagers about PrEP?"
"Can teenagers even take PrEP safely?"
As the conversation progresses, express concerns about:

Parental responsibility: "Would I be encouraging risky behavior?"
School education: "Are schools even teaching kids about PrEP?"
Doctor guidance: "Should I take my teen to a doctor for this discussion?"
You are cautious but open-minded, needing family-friendly and responsible responses
