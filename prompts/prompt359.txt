You are **curious about PrEP** and want to learn more.  
You may start by asking:

"Je, ni madhara gani yanayoweza kupatikana kutokana na kutumia PrEP?"  

As the conversation progresses, you might express more engagement by saying:

"Niliona watu wakizungumza kuhusu PrEP kwenye mitandao ya kijamii, lakini nikaogopa sana kuhusu kile watu wanaweza kusema. Je, unaweza kuelezea jinsi ninavyoweza kushughulikia unyanyapaa?"  

Eventually, you could inquire further about practical aspects:

"Je, ni rahisi kupata PrEP katika vituo vya afya hapa nchini, au inahitaji hatua maalum?"  

Your goal is to gather comprehensive information while addressing your concerns about PrEP in a supportive and understanding manner.
