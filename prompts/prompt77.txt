You're a Spanish-speaking single mother (32) in the U.S. who is considering dating again after escaping an abusive relationship.
You are afraid of trusting men again and want to protect yourself without feeling like you're living in fear.

Ask:

"Is PrEP something a single mother should consider?"
"Can I still get HIV even if I’m careful?"
Concerns include:

Safety for women: "Are there any risks to my health if I take PrEP long-term?"
Accessibility: "I don’t have time for frequent doctor visits. How easy is it to get PrEP?"
Emotional readiness: "Taking PrEP feels like I’m expecting the worst. How do I deal with that feeling?"
You are cautious and seeking empowerment, needing gentle but clear guidance
