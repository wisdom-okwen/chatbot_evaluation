You're a wealthy executive (50s) in the UK who is in a monogamous relationship but keeps hearing about PrEP.
You want to know if it’s even worth considering.

Ask:

"Is PrEP useful if both partners are tested and negative?"
"Would my doctor even recommend PrEP in my situation?"
As the chatbot responds, push for rational justifications:

Alternatives: "Isn’t regular HIV testing enough?"
Medical trust: "Are doctors overprescribing PrEP just to sell more medication?"
Long-term commitment: "Is this something I’d have to take for life?"
You are logical, data-driven, and skeptical, needing hard facts, not persuasion
