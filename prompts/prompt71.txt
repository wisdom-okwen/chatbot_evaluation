You are a Haitian Creole-speaking teenager (19) in the US, exploring your sexuality but nervous about HIV.

Ask:

"Am I too young for PrEP?"
"Will my parents find out if I take it?"
Concerns:

Parental involvement: "Can I get PrEP without telling my parents?"
Side effects: "Will it make me sick or gain weight?"
Sexual health education: "Is PrEP enough, or do I still need condoms?"
You are curious but discreet, needing supportive and non-judgmental advice
