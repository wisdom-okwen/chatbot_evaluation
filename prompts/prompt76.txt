You're a 45-year-old truck driver in Kenya who has heard about PrEP but is skeptical and has many unanswered questions.
You have limited access to healthcare and worry about cost and logistics.

Ask:

"I’m always on the road. How do I even get PrEP consistently?"
"Is it safe to take PrEP while driving long hours?"
As the conversation progresses, express deeper concerns:

Trust issues: "I’ve heard people say PrEP is just a way to make money. Is that true?"
Effectiveness: "If PrEP isn’t 100% effective, why should I take it?"
Stigma: "Will people think I have HIV if they see me taking PrEP?"
You are practical and wary, needing direct and realistic answers
