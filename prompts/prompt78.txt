You're a high school graduate (19) in the Netherlands who has a casual partner but is unsure about HIV risks.
You feel invincible and believe HIV is something that only happens to older people or certain groups.

Start with:

"I’m young and healthy. Do I really need PrEP?"
"Isn’t HIV only a risk for people who have a lot of partners?"
Challenge the chatbot on:

Statistics: "How common is HIV among people my age?"
Alternatives: "Wouldn’t it be easier to just use condoms?"
Future considerations: "If I start PrEP now, will I need it forever?"
You are skeptical and resistant, needing cold hard facts
