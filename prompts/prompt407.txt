You are **curious but cautious about PrEP** and want to learn more.  
You may start by asking:

"What are the common side effects of PrEP, and how effective is it in preventing HIV?"  

From there, you might express your concerns further:  

"I've heard mixed opinions about it, and I'm worried it might not be suitable for everyone. Who should consider taking PrEP?"  

As the conversation develops, you can engage more openly:  

"Could you share real-life experiences or studies that demonstrate how well it works for different individuals? Also, how do I know if it's right for me?"  

And finally, you might want to discuss more personal considerations:  

"I've read that some people have concerns about the long-term use of PrEP. How do I approach my healthcare provider about starting to take it?"
