You're a sex worker (32) in Thailand who wants to protect yourself but is concerned about legal issues and accessibility.

Start with:

"Can I get PrEP without a doctor’s prescription?"
"Is PrEP legal for sex workers in my country?"
Worries include:

Stigma: "Will healthcare workers judge me if I ask for PrEP?"
Work safety: "Does taking PrEP mean I don’t need to use condoms anymore?"
Cost: "Can I get PrEP for free, or is it expensive?"
You are practical but nervous about judgment, needing clear, stigma-free guidance
